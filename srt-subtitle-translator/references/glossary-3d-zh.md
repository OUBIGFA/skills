# Glossary — 3D / motion graphics, Simplified Chinese

Default renderings for 3D, motion-graphics, and VFX tutorial subtitles with a Simplified
Chinese target. Read it whenever the source video is about Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya,
3ds Max, Houdini, Redshift, Octane, Arnold, or any adjacent tool.

## The alignment rule

**One term per concept across every 3D application: Cinema 4D's Simplified Chinese
wording.** Not the Traditional Chinese rendering, not Blender's zh-CN strings, not the
literal dictionary word.

The reason is the audience, not the software. Chinese 3D viewers learned the vocabulary
from C4D's mainland localization, so those words are the ones that land instantly. A
subtitle that says 内插 when the viewer knows 内部挤压 has failed even though it is
"a translation" — the viewer stops, re-reads, and loses the demonstration on screen.

This holds even when the video is a Blender or Maya tutorial: translate `Inset Faces` as
`内部挤压`, not Blender's own 内插面; translate Maya's `Extrude` as `挤压`, not 挤出.

**The one exception: a feature that genuinely exists only in that application.** Keep its
own name — 几何节点（Geometry Nodes）, 蜡笔（Grease Pencil）, XPresso, MoSpline, Pyro,
Houdini's SOP/DOP/VOP/Wrangle, Redshift's AOV. There is no C4D word to align to, so the
software's own term is the correct term.

## This is a table of defaults, not a find-and-replace list

The goal of this skill is a subtitle that sounds like it was written in Chinese. A
glossary applied mechanically defeats that as thoroughly as a bad translation does — it
just fails in a more consistent way.

**Context outranks the table. Always.** Before using a row, ask which of these the
speaker is doing:

**1. Pointing at the screen, or narrating an action?** When the viewer has to find a
thing in a menu, a manager, or a parameter field, use the UI wording — that is the string
on screen and matching it is the whole point. When the speaker is just describing what
they are doing, use how a Chinese creator would actually say it out loud.

- `It's under Create > Null` → menu path, the UI word
- `Create a null and drop everything inside` → 新建一个空对象，把东西都放进去 —
  nobody says 新建一个空白 in speech
- `Set the falloff to 50` → parameter field, 衰减
- `It falls off toward the edges` → narration: 边缘会逐渐变淡, not 边缘衰减

**2. Which sub-field is this?** Many English words in this domain map to several unrelated
Chinese words. Getting this wrong doesn't read as awkward — it reads as nonsense. See the
next section.

**3. Is the English word doing real work here?** Speakers pad with `basically`, `just`,
`some`, `a little bit of`. `Add a little bit of noise` is 加一点噪波 — not a sentence
about 噪波量的少量增加. The glossary supplies the noun; the sentence is still yours to
write.

Two habits that keep the table honest: read the row, then read your line aloud in your
head and ask whether a Chinese creator would say it that way; and when the video uses a
term in a sense this file didn't anticipate, translate the sense, not the row.

**Parseability is the entry fee.** A viewer outside the niche must be able to roughly
guess a term's meaning from its characters. 大型 fails for *blocking*; 基础形体 passes.
When community slang fails the test, ship the plain wording with the original bracketed
at first appearance (基础形体（Blocking）), and keep the verbatim string for anything the
viewer watches being typed on screen (命名对象就叫 Blocking).

## Never these renderings

These are unconditional — no context makes them right. They are wrong words, not
context-sensitive choices.

| Never | Always | Source term | Why the drift happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| 内插、内插面 | **内部挤压** | Inner Extrude / Inset | Blender zh-CN uses 内插面; Traditional Chinese uses 内插 |
| 内插 | **插值** | Interpolation | 内插 is the Traditional Chinese / maths-textbook word |
| 视口 | **视窗** | Viewport | literal translation, common in game-engine docs |
| 挤出 | **挤压** | Extrude | Maya and Blender zh-CN both use 挤出 |
| 环境光遮蔽 | **环境吸收** | Ambient Occlusion / AO | the literal expansion of the English |
| 细分表面 | **细分曲面** | Subdivision Surface | literal rendering of "surface" |
| 摄影机 | **摄像机** | Camera | Traditional Chinese form |
| 关键画格、键帧 | **关键帧** | Keyframe | Traditional Chinese forms |
| 烘培 | **烘焙** | Bake | homophone typo, extremely common |
| 材料 | **材质** | Material | 材料 is physical stuff, not a shading asset |
| 大型 | **基础形体** | Blocking / Blockout | spoken shorthand ("拉大型"); outside the niche it reads as "large-scale" and parses as nothing |

Everything outside this table is a default that context can override.

## One English word, several Chinese words

Pick by what the speaker means, not by the first row. This is where mechanical glossary
use does the most damage.

**Null**
| Context | 中文 |
|---|---|
| Naming the menu item the viewer must click | the UI label — 空白 |
| Speech: a null used as a controller or parent | 空对象, or just 空 |
| Blender's *Empty* | 空物体 |
| A null value in XPresso, an expression, or script | 空值 |

**Noise** — 噪波 as a shader or procedural pattern; 噪点 as a render artefact; 噪声 or
杂音 for audio. `The render is still noisy` is 噪点还很多; `plug in a noise` is 接一个噪波.

**Light** — 灯光 for the object you create; 光线 for what travels and bounces; 光照 for
the resulting illumination. `The light bounces off the wall` → 光线打到墙上反弹, never
灯光反弹.

**Volume** — 体积 in 3D; 音量 for audio; C4D's Volume Builder is 体积生成.

**Field** — 域 for C4D Fields; 场 for a physical force field; 字段 for data.

**Scale** — 缩放 as the operation or parameter; 尺度 or 比例 when the speaker means how
big things are. `The scale of this scene is off` → 这个场景的尺度不对.

**Offset** — 偏移 as a parameter; 错开 when the speaker means staggering things in time.
`Offset the animation on each clone` → 让每个克隆体的动画错开.

**Frame** — 帧 as a unit of time; 画面 as the image; 构图 or 取景 when framing a shot.

**Render** — 渲染 as the verb; 渲染图 or 成品 for the finished image. `Compare it to the
final render` → 跟成品对比一下.

**Key** — 关键帧 in animation (`key it` → 打关键帧); 抠像 for keying/chroma key; 键 for
a keyboard key.

**Track** — 轨道 in a timeline; 跟踪 for motion tracking.

**Pass** — 通道 for a render pass; 遍 or 次 for an iteration. `Let's do another pass on
the lighting` → 布光再调一遍.

**Weight** — 权重 for vertex or bone weights; 重量 for mass in a simulation.

**Texture** — 纹理 is the image or procedural pattern itself; 贴图 is that texture wired
into a channel (法线贴图, 置换贴图). `Go grab a texture` → 找张纹理; `plug it into bump`
→ 接到凹凸贴图上.

**Displacement** — 置换 in materials; 位移 when the speaker means an object actually
moving.

**Clone** — 克隆 for the Cloner and the act; 克隆体 for the resulting copies. `The clones
are overlapping` → 克隆体重叠了.

**Deformer vs Modifier** — Blender's *Modifier* is a stack of procedural operations
(Subdivision, Array, Boolean, Solidify); C4D's *Deformer* is only the shape-bending
subset. `Add a modifier` in a Blender video → 修改器, its own system. `Add a Bend
modifier` → the operation is 弯曲变形器. Judge by which one the viewer must find.

## Stays in the original form

Product and vendor names, file formats, and established acronyms. Translating these makes
them unsearchable, which is the opposite of what a tutorial viewer needs.

- Applications and renderers: `Cinema 4D`, `Blender`, `Maya`, `Houdini`, `Redshift`,
  `Octane`, `Arnold`, `V-Ray`, `Unreal`, `After Effects`, `Nuke`
- Acronyms: `UV`, `HDRI`, `GI`, `AO`, `AOV`, `IK`, `FK`, `LUT`, `VDB`, `ACES`, `PBR`
- Formats: `OBJ`, `FBX`, `Alembic`, `USD`, `EXR`, `PNG`
- Application-exclusive features: `XPresso`, `MoSpline`, `Pyro`, `Geometry Nodes`,
  `Grease Pencil`, `Eevee`, `Cycles`, `SOP` / `DOP` / `VOP`, `Wrangle`, `Hypershade`

Abbreviations the speaker actually says stay as spoken: `C4D`, `AE`, `RS`, `PS`. Do not
expand `C4D` into `Cinema 4D` in a subtitle — it costs characters and the viewer already
knows it.

On first appearance of a concept the viewer may not connect to the English audio, use
`中文（English）` — `内部挤压（Inner Extrude）` — then the short form for the rest of the
file. Do this for the two or three terms the video is *about*, not for every row above.

## Beyond this list

This table covers 3D and motion graphics only. For a cooking, finance, or medical video,
build the equivalent list for that domain before translating, following the same two
principles: pick the wording the target audience already uses rather than the literal one,
and treat the list as defaults that the sentence's context can override.
